function 4- a function that plots data
for this function i will use ggplot to make a point plot of weight by species_id, grouped by sex. this will allow us to see not only which species_id may be larger than others, but also which species_id may be more populated with males or with females
example function: function4plot <- ggplot(data = surveysnonas, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = species_id, col = sex)) + geom_point()
