# hanhart.pkg

## An R package for consolidating data and making it easier to interpret.

This R package takes overwhelming data and condenses it, then turns the final plot pink. 

An R package for those such as myself, coding dummies. Therefor, we will be sticking to the basics, using only the following: tidyverse, broom, dplyr, ggplot2, and knitr.

The end goal of this package is to make it less difficult to understand, then turn the final plot pink so I enjoy looking at it more.
